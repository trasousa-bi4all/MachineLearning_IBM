All the arts and crafts of IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate

In this notebook, I will be analyzing the World Happiness Report from the 2020 dataset as Part of the Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning course by IBM. With this, I hope to get more hands-on experience in communicating insightful and impactful findings. Throughout this project, I will use the tools and techniques that I have learned in the course. I will also produce a report that will be available in this repository, feel free to read and share your thoughts on the matter, if you think that I can make any improvements share it with me. ðŸ˜€
